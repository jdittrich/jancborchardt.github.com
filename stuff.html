<p>This is <a href="#own">stuff I have</a> and <a href="#giveaway">stuff I give away</a>.


<h1 id="own"><a href="#own">All I own</a></h1>
<p><em>Fits in a carry-on backpack, costs about 1500 â‚¬ and weighs ~8 kg.</em>
<p>I try to strike a balance between quality and price, but tend to go for more well-designed and long-lasting equipment than cheap throwaway products.
<p>This stuff is reasonably good for all-weather, and works for -10Â° C snowy Europe as well as 30Â° sunny South East Asia. Iâ€™m quite resistant to the cold though, so the exact jacket, pants or number of layers might vary for you.
<p>I prefer black, especially for clothing. Any labels get cut and logos blacked out or scratched off.

<h2>Tech</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>ðŸ’» laptop</strong><br>
	Needs to be light, thin and have a great battery life. The build quality of the <a href="">Samsung 900X3E</a> (~1000 â‚¬) is good and Linux works great on it.<br>
	A good alternative is a <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/">Chromebook</a> with <a href="http://chromeos-cr48.blogspot.com">ChrUbuntu</a> on it.

	<li><strong>ðŸ“± smartphone</strong><br>
	<a href="https://www.amazon.de/Motorola-Smartphone-HD-Display-Quad-Core-Prozessor-Micro-SIM-Steckplatz/dp/B00L2519WK/">Moto G first generation</a> (~160 â‚¬, 222 g), with CyanogenMod. Size of 4,5" and form factor is perfect, only the internal storage (8 GB) and the camera could be better. But great smartphones below 5" arenâ€™t made anymore these days â€¦

	<li><strong>ðŸŽ§ earphones</strong><br>
	<a href="//www.p4c.philips.com/cgi-bin/dcbint/cpindex.pl?ctn=SHE9000/28">Philips SHE9000</a> (28 â‚¬, 10 g) are great small, reasonably priced and well-designed in-ear headphones. The plug is angled for less obstruction and the cable is partly fiber-coated to prevent tangled cords. They are even useful on their own just for noise cancellation.<br>
	Might switch to bluetooth earbuds (like <a href="https://store.bragi.com/de_en/the-headphone.html">Bragi Headphone</a>) if that stuff ever starts to work and have reasonable battery life.

	<li class="external"><strong>external</strong><br>
	Other than what I have with me, I need power & wifi to work. I prefer working at a standing desk, or in cafÃ©s, or somewhere outside if possible.
</ul>

<h2>Clothes</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>jacket</strong><br>
	<a href="https://www.amazon.de/Mammut-Herren-Softshelljacke-Ultimate-1010-14900-0052-113/dp/B00GHWZMXK/">Mammut Ultimate Hoody</a> (170 â‚¬, 540 g) is really good, light and I find myself wearing it all the time, even for snowboarding.

	<li><strong>sweater</strong><br>
	A standard dark grey longsleeve pullover (10 â‚¬, 290 g) from H&M. Useful for when itâ€™s a bit colder, and the only longsleeve I have next to the jacket.

	<li><strong>ðŸ‘• shirts</strong><br>
	3 T-shirts (ea. 5 â‚¬, 130 g), preferably blank.

	<li><strong>ðŸ‘– pants</strong><br>
	2 pairs of long pants (sometimes only one), Zara slim (40 â‚¬). Then a pair of shorts which can also be used for sports and swimming.

	<li><strong>underwear</strong><br>
	3 pair (10 â‚¬), simple.

	<li><strong>ðŸ‘Ÿ shoes</strong><br>
	Sandals, currently <a href="http://www.unshoesusa.com/feather.html">Unshoes Wokova Feather</a> (50 â‚¬). Then a pair of <strong>simple sneakers</strong> for skateboarding or other occasions. I often just go barefoot.

	<li><strong>ðŸ•¶ sunglasses</strong><br>
	Ray Ban Erika have the nicest shape and the glasses are not too dark. Great also for snowboarding and cycling.

	<li class="external"><strong>external</strong><br>
	A roof and floor to sleep â€“ or bivouacking. Washing mashine or hand wash for cleaning clothes. When traveling I often use <a href="https://trustroots.org">Trustroots</a>.
</ul>

<h2>Hygiene</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>brush teeth</strong><br>
	<a href="//www.dr-best.de/produkte/zahnbuersten_erwachsene/atemfrisch.jsp">Dr. Best breath fresh</a> (3 â‚¬) is the best toothbrush. Ergonomic handle, great brush, tongue scraper and more details. Plus any small toothpaste.

	<li><strong>clean</strong><br>
	For showering I use <strong>Dr Bronnerâ€™s soap</strong> eucalyptus flavor.

	<li><strong>cut</strong><br>
	Haircuts I do myself, and <strong>scissors</strong> are also useful to cut nails and in general for fixing up stuff. Still searching for a good one, but will probably be a small kids scissorcs with blunt tip so it can be carried on an airplane.

	<li><strong>shave</strong><br>
	<a href="http://www.merkur-razors.com/index.html">Merkur 23C</a> safety razor. Much better than a cartridge razor.

	<li><strong>tissues</strong><br>
	For sneezing, fixing wounds, wiping and more.

	<li class="external"><strong>external</strong><br>
	shower & toilet
</ul>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>backpack</strong><br>
	<a href="http://www.haglofs.com/gb/en/Backpacks-and-Bags/CORKER-MEDIUM/p/339005.2EN">HaglÃ¶fs Corker 18l</a> (60 â‚¬, 820 g) is a light, nice looking backpack without a bunch of straps. Also has a good amount of compartments from laptop to small stuff. Using it for years now and itâ€™s perfect.

	<li><strong>money</strong><br>
	Some cash, debit card & credit card.

	<li><strong>ID</strong><br>
	I rarely drive but the <strong>drivers license</strong> is good as small photo ID. And a <strong>passport</strong> for traveling.

	<li><strong>health</strong><br>
	Passes for insurance, vaccination, radiology & organ donation.

	<li class="external"><strong>external</strong><br>
	I love to <strong>bike</strong> so I always like using one wherever Iâ€™m at. I fixed up and gifted several bikes myself and usually someone has a bike theyâ€™re not using.

<h2>Sports equipment</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>bicycle</strong><br>
	Cinelli Gazzetta!

	<li><strong>snowboard</strong><br>
	Burton rental board I bought


<h2>Not carrying</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>towel</strong><br>
	Most places where you need one (like a swimming pool) have towels anyway. And microfiber towels like <a href="//cascadedesigns.com/packtowl">Packtowl</a> feel really odd.

	<li><strong>deodorant</strong><br>
	Stopped using deodorant quite some time ago. In combination with the moisture-wicking of the merino wool itâ€™s not a problem.

	<li><strong>pen & paper</strong><br>
	Previously I used the <a href="http://www.spacepen.com/matteblackbullet.aspx">Fisher Space Pen</a> and a softcover Moleskine but gave it to a friend. I take notes exclusively on the phone. Whenever I need to sketch something, any pen and paper will do.
</ul>
